# The Effect of Lynchings on Black Voter Registration

Hi everyone! Rami here and this is my project. I've analyzed data to find the effect of lynchings on Black voter registration in a few Southern states. This project is based on research done by Dr. Jhacova Williams of the RAND Corporation.

Honestly, I wasn't able to reproduce all of her results but I was able to reproduce some. What we've found is that in certain states like Louisiana, Black voter registration is lower in counties that had more lynchings in their past. However, this trend wasn't found in Alabama or North Carolina.
