# The Effect of Lynchings on Black Voter Registration

Hi everyone! Rami here and this is my project. I've analyzed data to find the effect of lynchings on Black voter registration in a few Southern states. This project is based on research done by Dr. Jhacova Williams of the RAND Corporation.

Honestly, I wasn't able to reproduce all of her results but I was able to reproduce some. What we've found is that in certain states like Louisiana, Black voter registration is lower in counties that had more lynchings in their past. However, this trend wasn't found in Alabama or North Carolina.

This first regression above is for Alabama. As you can see, within counties a history of more lynchings is associated with higher Black voter registration.

Here you can see that in Louisana, more lynchings within a county/parish are correlated with lower Black voter registration.

North Carolina follows much of the same logic as Alabama.

Below are the counties with the highest Black voter registration:
